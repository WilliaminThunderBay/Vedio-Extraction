 Welcome to module 7, Course Wrap Up. Congratulations on completing the AWS Academy Machine Learning course. We'll take a few minutes to review what you've learned and where you can go from here. We're going to start with a review of what you've learned in this course. You learned how to describe machine learning, implement a machine learning pipeline, and use Amazon Machine Learning Services for forecasting your course. Well done. Although this course isn't designed to prepare you to become certified for the AWS certified machine learning specialty, we'll review how you can continue to work towards that certification. AWS certification helps you build credibility and confidence by validating your cloud expertise with an industry-recognized credential. It also helps organizations identify skilled professionals who can lead cloud initiatives by using AWS. You must earn a passing score by taking a proctored exam to earn an AWS certification. After receiving a passing score, you'll receive your certification credentials. AWS certification doesn't publish a list of all services or features that are covered in a certification exam. However, there's an exam guide for each exam, and it lists the current topic areas and objectives covered in the exam. Exam guides can be found on the Prepare for your AWS certification exam webpage. You'll be required to update your certification or recertify every three years. View the AWS certification recertification page for more details. The information on this slide is current as of June 2020. However, exams are frequently updated. Also, the details regarding which exams are available and what topics are tested by each exam are subject to change. The AWS certified machine learning specialty means you can select and justify the appropriate machine learning approach for a given business problem. You can also identify appropriate AWS services to implement machine learning solutions. And finally, you can design and implement scalable, cost optimized, reliable and secure machine learning solutions. Before sitting for the AWS certified machine learning specialty exam, we recommend that you have the following knowledge and experience. First, you should have one to two years of experience developing, architecting or running ML or deep learning workloads on the AWS cloud. Your experience should include performing basic hyperparameter optimization and working with machine learning and deep learning frameworks. You should also be able to express the intuition behind basic ML algorithms. Finally, you should be able to follow best practices for model training in addition to best practices for deployment and operations. Thanks for watching and congratulations on completing the AWS Academy Machine Learning course.
