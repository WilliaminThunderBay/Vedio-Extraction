 Welcome back. In this section, we'll review five managed machine learning services you can use for various use cases. These services simplify the process of creating a machine learning application. We'll start by looking at Amazon Transcribe. You can use Amazon Transcribe to recognize speech in audio files and produce a transcription. It can recognize specific voices in an audio file and you can create a customized vocabulary for terms that are specialized for a particular domain. You can also add a transcription service to your applications by integrating with web sockets, an internet protocol you can use for two-way communication between an application and Amazon Transcribe. Here are some of the more common use cases for Amazon Transcribe. First, medical professionals can record their notes and Amazon Transcribe can capture their spoken notes as text. Also, video production organizations can generate subtitles automatically from video. This could also be done in real time for a live feed to add closed captioning. Media companies can use Amazon Transcribe to capture and label content. They can then feed the content into Amazon Comprehend for further analysis. Last, companies can record customer service or sales calls and transcribe them. They can analyze the results for training or for strategic opportunities. Amazon Poly can convert text into lifelike speech. You can input either plain text files or a file that's formatted in Speech Synthesis Markup Language or SSML. SSML is a markup language used to provide special instructions for how speech should sound. For example, if you want to introduce a pause in the flow of speech, you can add an SSML tag that instructs Amazon Poly to pause between two words. You can also output speech from Amazon Poly to MP3, Vorbis, and PCM Audio Stream formats. Amazon Poly is eligible for use with certain regulated workloads. For example, it's eligible for use with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or HIPAA. Amazon Poly is also eligible for use with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard or PCI DSS. Here are some of the more common use cases for Amazon Poly. As a first example, major news companies are using Amazon Poly to generate vocal content directly from their written stories. It's also been embedded in mapping APIs so developers can add voice to their geo-based applications. Language training companies have used Amazon Poly to create systems for learning a new language. Finally, animators have used it to add voices to their characters. With Amazon Translate, you can create multi-language experiences in your applications. You can create systems that read documents in one language and then render or store them in another language. You can also use it as part of a document analysis system. Amazon Translate is fully integrated with other machine learning services such as Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Transcribe, and Amazon Poly. With this integration, you can extract named entities, sentiment, and key phrases by integrating it with Amazon Comprehend, create multilingual subtitles with Amazon Transcribe, and speak translated content with Amazon Poly. Here are some of the more common use cases for Amazon Translate. The first use case is building international websites. You can use Amazon Translate to quickly globalize your websites. Amazon Translate can also be used to develop multilingual chatbots. Chatbots are used to create a more human-like interface to applications. With Amazon Translate, you can create a chatbot that speaks multiple languages. Another use case is software localization. Localization is a major cost for all software aimed at a global audience. Amazon Translate can decrease software development time and significantly reduce costs for localizing software. The final example use case is international media management. Companies that manage media for a global audience have used Amazon Translate to reduce their costs for localization. Amazon Comprehend implements many of the NLP techniques that we reviewed earlier in this module. You can extract key entities, perform sentiment analysis, and tag words with parts of speech. Here are some of the more common use cases for Amazon Comprehend. The first example is analyzing legal and medical documents. Legal, insurance, and medical organizations have used Amazon Comprehend to perform many of the NLP functions we reviewed in this module. Another use is for large-scale mobile app analysis. Mobile app developers use Amazon Comprehend to look for patterns of usage with their apps so they can design improvements. Financial fraud detection is another use case for Amazon Comprehend. Banking, financial, and other institutions have used it to examine very large data sets of financial transactions to uncover fraud and look for patterns of illegal transactions. Finally, it can be used for content management. Media and other content companies can use Amazon Comprehend to tag content for analysis and management. With Amazon Lex, you can add a human language front-end to your applications. Amazon Lex lets you use the same conversational engine that powers Amazon Alexa. You can automatically increase capacity for your Amazon Lex solution by creating AWS Lambda functions that scale on demand. You can also store log files of the conversations for further analysis. Here are some of the more common use cases for Amazon Lex. The first use case is building front-end interfaces for inventory management and sales. Voice interfaces are becoming more common. Companies have used Amazon Lex to add chatbots to their inventory and sales applications. Another use for Amazon Lex is creating customer service interfaces. Human-like voice applications are quickly becoming the standard for many customer service applications. Amazon Lex can reduce the time it takes to develop these chatbots and increase their quality. Amazon Lex can also be used to develop interactive assistance. By combining Amazon Lex with other ML services, customers are creating more sophisticated assistance for many different industries. The final example use case is querying databases with a human-like language. Amazon Lex has been combined with other AWS database services to create sophisticated data analysis applications with a human-like language interface. Here are some of the main points you should take away from this module. First, Amazon Transcribe can automatically convert spoken language to text. Amazon Poly can convert written text to spoken language. Amazon Translate can create real-time translation between languages. Amazon Comprehend automates many of the NLP use cases reviewed in this module. And finally, Amazon Lex can create a human-like interface to your applications. Thanks for watching. We'll see you in the next video.
