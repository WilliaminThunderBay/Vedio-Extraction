 It's now time to summarize some of the main points in this module. In this module, you learned how to describe the use cases for computer vision, describe the Amazon Managed Machine Learning Services available for image and video analysis, list the steps required to prepare a custom dataset for object detection, describe how Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth can be used to prepare a custom dataset, and use Amazon Recognition to perform facial detection. That concludes this introduction to computer vision. Thanks for watching. We'll see you again in the next video.
