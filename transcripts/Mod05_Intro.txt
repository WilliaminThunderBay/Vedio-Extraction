 Welcome back to AWS Academy Machine Learning. This is module 5, and we have a great topic for you today, computer vision. In this module, we'll start with an overview of the computer vision space, and you'll learn about some of the use cases and terminology. Next, we'll explore details about analyzing image and video with managed services from Amazon Web Services or AWS. Finally, we'll look at how you can use your own customized data sets for performing object detection. At the end of this module, you'll be able to describe the use cases for computer vision, describe the Amazon Managed Machine Learning services available for image and video analysis, list the steps required to prepare a custom data set for object detection, describe how Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth can be used to prepare a custom data set, and finally, use Amazon Recognition to perform facial detection. Thanks for watching. We'll see you in the next video.
