 Hi, and welcome to section 1. We'll get started by reviewing what forecasting is and some use cases for it. Forecasting is an important area of machine learning. It's important because there are so many opportunities for predicting future outcomes based on historical data. Many of these opportunities involve a time component. However, while the time component adds additional information, it also makes time series problems more difficult to handle compared to other types of predictions. You can think of time series data as falling into two broad categories. The first type is univariate data, which means there's just one variable. The second one is multivariate data, which means there's more than one variable. There are several common patterns in time series data. The first pattern is a trend. With a trend, you get a pattern with the values increasing, decreasing, or staying the same over time. There are seasonal patterns. These reflect times of the year, month, day, or other patterns. Cyclical patterns are similar to seasonal patterns. These are patterns that repeat. Like a large retail sale event that happens the same time each year. Finally, there are changes in the data over time that appear to be random or that have no discernible pattern. There are many uses for forecasting. You can use forecasting in marketing applications, such as for sales forecasting or demand projections. It could also be used in inventory management systems that anticipate required inventory levels. Forecasting energy consumption can help predict when and where energy is needed. And weather forecasting systems can be used for governments in commercial applications, such as agriculture. That's it for this section. See you in the next video.
