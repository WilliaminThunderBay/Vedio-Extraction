 Hi, and welcome to section 1. In this section, we're going to talk about what machine learning is. This course is an introduction to machine learning, which is also known as ML. But first, we'll discuss where machine learning fits into the larger picture. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, or AI. This is a broad branch of computer science that's focused on building machines that can do human tasks. Deep learning is a subdomain of machine learning. To understand where these all fit together, we'll discuss each one. As we just mentioned, machine learning is a subset of a broader computer science field known as artificial intelligence. AI focuses on building machines that can perform tasks a human would typically perform. In contemporary popular culture, you've probably seen AIs in movies, television, or works of fiction. For example, you might have seen AIs that control the world around them, or that start acting on their own initiative. These AIs started as computer agents that perceive their environments and take actions to achieve a specific goal, though maybe not the outcome the creators originally wished for. Other fictional AIs interact extensively with humans as helpers or workers, and they generally do a better job working with humanity, but they're more general in purpose. These kinds of AIs are examples of artificial general intelligence, or AGI. They have the capacity to learn or understand any task that a human can. AI problems typically span many fields of research, such as natural language processing, reasoning, knowledge representation, learning, perception, and physical environment interaction. AI isn't yet a reality for us, unless we are all truly living in a simulation. But every year, we move closer to it in each of those areas. You might have also read or seen commentary on the ethics of creating AI. Not all views are positive, perhaps partly in fear of the malicious fictional AIs that want to destroy humanity or use them as power sources. Or perhaps they're concerned about the risk of mass unemployment because an intelligent machine could work 24-7 and not need any breaks. Don't worry though, we're not going to build the next rogu AI in this course, maybe in the next one. If you do a search, you'll probably find many definitions of machine learning. There isn't a universally agreed upon definition, so we'll start by looking at a couple of definitions. For example, we could say machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models to perform a task by using inference instead of instructions. This isn't a bad starting point. The key point here is using algorithms and statistical models instead of instructions. To help you better understand this, we'll apply this idea to a concrete example. Suppose you need to write an application that determines if an email message is spam or not. Without machine learning, you'd need to write a complex series of decision statements using IF and ELSE statements. You'd also need to use words in the subject or body, the number of links, and the length of the message to determine if an email message is spam. It would be hard and labor-intensive to build a large set of rules covering every possibility. With machine learning, however, you could use a list of email messages that were marked as spam or not spam, and train a machine learning model. The model would then learn which patterns of words, length, and other attributes are good indicators of spam messages. If you presented the model with an email message it hadn't seen before, the model would perform a prediction to say whether the message was spam or not spam. Deep learning represents a significant leap forward in the capabilities for artificial intelligence and machine learning. The theory behind deep learning was created from how the human brain works. An artificial neural network, or ANN, is inspired by the biological neurons found in the brain. Although the implementation has become very different. Artificial neurons have one or more inputs and a single output. These neurons fire or activate their outputs based on a transformation of the inputs. A neural network is composed of layers of these artificial neurons, with connections between the layers. There are typically input, output, and hidden layers in the network. The output of a single neuron connects to the inputs of all the neurons in the next layer. The network is then asked to solve a problem. The input layer is populated from the training data, and the neurons activate throughout the layers until an answer is presented in the output layer. The accuracy of the output is then measured. If the output doesn't meet your threshold, the training is repeated, but with slight changes to the weights of the connections between neurons. The neural network will do this repeatedly. Each time it strengthens the connections that lead to success and diminishes the connections that lead to failure. As you'll see in this course, machine learning practitioners spend a lot of time optimizing the ML models, selecting the best data features to train with, and selecting the models with the best results. In contrast, deep learning practitioners spend almost no time on those tasks. Instead, they spend their time modeling data with different ANN architectures. Though the theory for deep learning goes back decades, the hardware needed to run deep learning problems wasn't generally accessible until recently. But now that it's available, you can use deep learning to address problems that are more complex than the problems you could have worked on before. Mainstream machine learning is a recent occurrence. Rapid advancements in machine and deep learning only started around the mid-2000s. This is partly because Moore's law and the rise of cloud computing resulted in easier access to larger, faster, and cheaper compute and storage capabilities. You can now rent computing power for a few hours for pennies. Before this, you needed substantial investments to buy and operate large-scale compute clusters on your own. In 2012, neural networks started to be used in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, a machine learning competition for image recognition. The accuracy rate jumped up to about 82% and has been steadily climbing ever since. In fact, it exceeded human performance in 2015. Here are some of the key takeaways for this section. First, artificial intelligence is the broad field of building machines to perform human tasks. Also, machine learning is a subset of AI. It focuses on using data to train machine learning models so they can make predictions. Deep learning is a technique inspired from human biology. It uses layers of artificial neurons to build networks that solve problems. And last, advancements in technology, cloud computing, and algorithm development have led to a corresponding advance in machine learning capabilities and applications. That's it for this section. We'll see you in the next video.
