 It's now time to review the module. Here are the main takeaways for this module. First, we looked at defining machine learning and how it fits into the broader AI landscape. We also looked at the types of problem machine learning can help us solve and how machine learning applies learning algorithms to develop models from large data sets. We then looked at the machine learning pipeline and the different stages for developing a machine learning application. Finally, we introduced some of the tools and services you can use before discussing some of the challenges with machine learning. In summary, in this module you learned how to recognize how machine learning and deep learning are part of artificial intelligence. Describe artificial intelligence and machine learning terminology. Identify how machine learning can be used to solve a business problem. Describe the machine learning process. List the tools available to data scientists. Identify when to use machine learning instead of traditional software development methods. Thanks for watching. We'll see you in the next video.
