 Hi, welcome back. This is section 5, and we're going to discuss challenges with machine learning. You'll come across many challenges in machine learning. There are a lot of poor quality and inconsistent data available. A significant portion of your job will be getting access to or generating enough good data that's representative of the problem you want to solve. A key issue to watch out for is under or overfitting the model. It's not all about the data, although it mostly is. Do you have data science experience? Is staffing a team of data scientists cost effective? Does management support using machine learning? What does the business landscape look like? Are the problems too complex to formulate into a machine learning problem? Can the resulting model be explained to the business? If it can't be explained, it might not get adopted. What's the cost of building, updating, and operating a machine learning solution? Finally, how does the technology map? Does the business unit have access to the data that's needed? Can the data be secured to meet any regulatory requirements? What tools and frameworks will be used? How will the solution integrate with other systems? These are important questions. To be successful, you'll need to be able to answer and address them. Many machine learning problems can be solved today by using existing models and without substantial machine learning knowledge. We've already talked about the AWS managed services for machine learning. You can add sophisticated machine learning capabilities to your applications with only some basic developer skills for calling APIs. There are other pre-built models you can use or adapt. One example is YOLO, which means you only look once. YOLO is a popular computer vision model. In addition to these scenarios, you can use the AWS Marketplace if you'd prefer to buy models and services from independent software vendors instead of developing your own. Here are the key takeaways for this section. First, you'll face many machine learning challenges. The biggest ones that you can directly influence are related to data. You should consider managed services to solve machine learning problems within the domains they support, such as using Amazon Recognition for computer vision problems. That's it for this section. We'll see you in the next video.
