 Hi, welcome back. Now we'll review how to find correlations in your dataset. How can you quantify the linear relationship among the variables you're seeing in a scatterplot? A correlation matrix is a good tool in this situation. It conveys both the strong and weak linear relationships among numerical variables. Correlation can go as high as 1 or as low as minus 1. When the correlation is 1, this means those two numerical features are perfectly correlated with each other. It's like saying y is proportional to x. When the correlation of those two variables is minus 1, it's like saying y is proportional to minus x. Any linear relationship in between can be quantified by the correlation. So if the correlation is 0, this means there's no linear relationship. But it doesn't mean that there's no relationship. It's just an indication that there's no linear relationship between those two variables. However, looking at a number isn't always straightforward. Often it's easier to view the numbers when they're represented by colors. Now we'll look at the heat map. The highest number, 1, in dark green, and minus 1 is in dark brown. The color gives you both the positive and negative directions, and it also shows how strong the correlations are. We can use the seaborne heat map function to show the correlation matrix. Looking at the chart, there's some correlation between citric acid and fixed acidity. That would be expected in wine because citric acid contributes to the acidity of the wine. However, there isn't much correlation between fixed acidity and pH. pH is a measurement of the strength of those acids present. But fixed acidity is a measure of the quantity. In this particular data set, there doesn't appear to be a correlation here. Some key takeaways from this section of the module include these points. The first step is to get your data into a format that can be used easily. PENDIS is a popular Python library for working with data. Descriptive statistics will help you gain insights into the data. You can use visualizations to examine the data set in more detail. That's it for this section. We'll see you again in the next video.
