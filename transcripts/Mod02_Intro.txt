 Hi, and welcome to Module 2 of AWS Academy Machine Learning. In this module, we're going to introduce machine learning. We'll first look at the business problems that can be solved by machine learning. We'll then talk about terminology, process, tools, and some of the challenges you'll face. After completing this module, you should be able to recognize how machine learning and deep learning are part of artificial intelligence. Describe artificial intelligence and machine learning terminology. Identify how machine learning can be used to solve a business problem. Describe the machine learning process. List the tools available to data scientists. And identify when to use machine learning instead of traditional software development methods. You're now ready to get started with Section 1. See you in the next video.
