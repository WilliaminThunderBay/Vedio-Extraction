 Hi, welcome back. We'll continue exploring data collection by reviewing how to secure your data. It's important to consider the security of your data. Though the data sets used in this course are all public, real data about customer transactions or health records need to be kept secure. You can use AWS Identity and Access Management, which is also known as IAM. It's a service that controls access to resources. Make sure you're securing your data within AWS correctly so you can avoid data breaches. The diagram shows a simple IAM policy that allows only read access to a specific S3 bucket for the listed role. In addition to controlling access to data, you need to make sure your data is secure. It's a good practice and it might also be legally required for certain data types, such as financial data or health care records. AWS provides encryption features for storage services, typically for data that's at rest or in transit. You can often meet these encryption requirements by enabling encryption on the object or service you want to protect. For data in transit, you must use secure transports like secure sockets layer, transport layer security or SSL TLS. Another aspect to consider is compliance audits. When dealing with data from regulated industries, you'll often need to audit access to the data. AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor and retain account activity related to actions across your entire AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail provides an event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS management console, AWS SDKs, command line tools and other AWS services. This event history simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking and troubleshooting. You can also use CloudTrail to detect unusual activity in your AWS accounts. All these features can help you simplify operational analysis and troubleshooting. Here are the key takeaways for this section. We looked at the first step in solving machine learning problems, obtaining the data required to train your machine learning model. We also reviewed how ETL can be used to obtain data from multiple sources. Services like AWS Glue can make it easy to obtain data from multiple data stores. Finally, make sure you understand your security requirements. These are based on both business need and any regulatory requirements. Also, make sure your data is secure. Only authorized users should be able to access your data and it should be encrypted where possible. That's it for section two. We'll see you in the next video.
