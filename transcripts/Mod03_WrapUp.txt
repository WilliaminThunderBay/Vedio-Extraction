 It's now time to review the module and wrap up with a knowledge check. In this module, you learned how to formulate a problem from a business request, obtain and secure data for machine learning, build a Jupyter notebook by using Amazon SageMaker, outline the process for evaluating data, explain why data needs to be pre-processed, use open source tools to examine and pre-process data, use Amazon SageMaker to train and host a machine learning model, use cross-validation to test the performance of an ML model, use a hosted model for inference, and create an Amazon SageMaker hyperparameter tuning job to optimize a model's effectiveness. That concludes this module. Thanks for watching. We'll see you again in the next video.
