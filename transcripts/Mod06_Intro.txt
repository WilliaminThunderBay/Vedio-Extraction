 Hi, and welcome to module 6 of AWS Academy Machine Learning, Introduction to Natural Language Processing. In this module, we'll introduce natural language processing, which is also known as NLP. This section includes a description of the major challenges faced by NLP and the overall development process for NLP applications. We'll then review five AWS services you can use to speed up the development of NLP-based applications. After completing this module, you should be able to describe the NLP use cases that are solved by using managed Amazon ML services and describe the managed Amazon ML services available for NLP. Let's get started.
