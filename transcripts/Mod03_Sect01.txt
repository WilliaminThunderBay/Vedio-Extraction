 Hi, and welcome back to Module 3. This is Section 1, and we're going to take a look at some of the datasets we'll use in this module. We'll also look at guidance for how to formulate a business problem. Before we get started, here's a reminder of the machine learning pipeline we looked at in the previous module, and how that maps to the sections in this module. This section, Section 1, will cover how to formulate a problem. It will also cover the datasets we'll use throughout this module. Section 2 will discuss how to obtain and secure data for your machine learning activities. In Section 3, we'll show you tools and techniques for gaining and understanding of your data. Then in Section 4, we'll look at pre-processing your data so it's ready to train a model. Section 5 will cover selecting and training an appropriate machine learning model. Section 6 will show you how to deploy a model so you can make a prediction. Section 7 will examine the process of evaluating the performance of a machine learning model. And finally, in Section 8, we'll look at tuning the model. The machine learning pipeline is an iterative process. When you work on a real-world problem, you might find yourself iterating many times before you arrive at a solution that meets your business's needs. In this first section, we'll examine how to think about turning a business requirement into a machine learning problem. The first step in this phase is to simply define the problem you want to solve and the goal you want to reach. Understanding the business goal is key because you'll use it to measure the performance of your solution. It's not unusual to solidify the business problem before you can begin targeting a solution. There are a lot of other questions you could ask to develop a good understanding of the problem. With more information about the problem, you can begin framing an approach. First, can the problem even be solved by machine learning? Or would a traditional approach make more sense? Is this a supervised or unsupervised machine learning problem? Do you have labeled data to train a supervised model? There are many questions you could ask yourself and the business. Ultimately, you should try to validate the use of machine learning and you should make sure you have access to the right people and data. You should also try to come up with the simplest solution to the problem. Here's an example. You want to identify fraudulent credit card transactions so you can stop the transaction before it processes. That's your problem. Now, what's the business goal or outcome driving this problem statement? In this case, say that the intended outcome is a reduction in the number of customers who end their membership to the credit card as a result of a fraudulent transaction. From a business perspective, how do you define success given this problem and the desired outcome? This is the stage where you need to move from qualitative statements to quantitative statements that can be easily measured. Starting with the example, a metric you could use to define success with this problem might be a 10% reduction in the number of customers who file claims for fraudulent transactions within a six-month period. So now you've defined the business side of your problem. It's time to start thinking about this in terms of your machine learning model itself. What's the actual output you want to see from your model? You want to be specific here. It should be a statement that reflects what an ML model could actually output. An example might be the model will output whether or not a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not fraudulent. Now that you know what you want your ML model to actually achieve, you can use this information to determine the type of ML you're working with. If you have historical data where customers filed reports for fraud transactions, you can use this data for your machine learning purpose. This historical data falls under the supervised learning approach where the labels are already defined. Recall from earlier in this course that supervised ML types are categorized into two groups, classification and regression. In the credit card example, the desired output of categorizing a transaction is fraud or not fraud. So you can see that you're dealing with a binary classification problem. Throughout this module, you'll see several data sets being used. You can access these data sets and many more from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The first data set contains numerical information about the composition of wine, along with the quality of the wine. The question you might want to ask on this data set is, based on the composition of the wine, could we predict the quality and therefore the price? In addition to that question, we'll also use this data set to view statistics, deal with outliers and scale numerical data. The second data set is a car evaluation database. This data set is heavily text based. This enables you to explore the encoding categorical data, which converts the text values into numbers that can be processed by machine learning. The third data set is a biomedical data set, which you'll also use in the labs. The question to answer for this data set is, based on the biomechanical features, can you predict if a patient has an abnormality? This data set will take you through the entire end-to-end process. You'll end with a trained model that's been tuned and that you can use to make a prediction. In this section, we looked at how business problems need to be converted into an ML problem. We also looked at some of the key questions to ask, which are, what is defining success? Can you measure the outcome or impact if your solution is implemented? Most business problems fall into one of two categories. The first category is classification, which can be binary or multi-class. Ask yourself, does the target belong to a class? And the second category is regression. For this, ask yourself, can you predict a numerical value? That's it for section one. We'll see you in the next video.
