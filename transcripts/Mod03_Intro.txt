 Welcome back to AWS Academy Machine Learning. This is module 3, and we're going to work through the entire machine learning pipeline by using Amazon SageMaker. This module will discuss a typical process for handling a machine learning problem. The machine learning pipeline can be applied to many machine learning problems. The focus is on supervised learning, but the purpose is to provide a machine learning pipeline. But the process you learn in this module can be adapted to other types of machine learning as well. This is a large module, and we'll be covering a lot of material. At the end of this module, you'll be able to formulate a problem from a business request, obtain and secure data for machine learning, build a Jupyter notebook by using Amazon SageMaker, outline the process for evaluating data, explain why data needs to be pre-processed, use open-source tools to examine and pre-process data, use Amazon SageMaker to train and host a machine learning model, use cross-validation to test the performance of a machine learning model, use a hosted model for inference, and finally, create an Amazon SageMaker hyperparameter tuning job to optimize a model's effectiveness. We're ready to get started. See you in the next video.
