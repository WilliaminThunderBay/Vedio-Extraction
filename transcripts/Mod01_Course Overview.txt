And lastly, in section 5, you'll get an overview of some of the common challenges you'll face when working with machine learning problems. In module 3, you'll get an introduction to Amazon SageMaker and how you can use it to implement a machine learning pipeline. The module focuses on the application of machine learning to solve problems with several public domain data sets as examples of the machine learning pipeline. Section 1 introduces you to defining business problems and the data sets we will use during this module. Section 2 through 8 describes the phases of the machine learning pipeline by using computer vision as an example application. In section 2, you'll learn how to collect and secure data. Section 3 describes different techniques for evaluating data. In section 4, you'll learn about the process of feature engineering. Section 5 describes the steps you'll take to train a model with SageMaker. In section 6, you'll get an overview of the options in SageMaker for hosting and using a model. Finally, section 7 and 8 cover how to evaluate and tune your model with SageMaker. In this module, you'll be introduced to using machine learning to create forecasts based on a time series data. In section 1, you'll be introduced to forecasting in some of its common applications. Section 2 outlines some of the pitfalls of using time series data to make forecasts. Finally, in section 3, you'll get an overview of how to use Amazon Forecast. In this module, you'll learn about using machine learning for computer vision. Section 1 describes the general problems you can solve with computer vision. In section 2, you'll learn about the process for analyzing images and videos. And in section 3, you'll learn the steps you'll need to take to prepare data sets for computer vision. In this module, you'll be introduced to natural language processing with machine learning. In section 1, you'll learn about the general set of problems you can solve with natural language processing. Section 2 reviews some of the managed Amazon machine learning services you can use to address natural language processing problems. These services include Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Translate, Amazon Lex, Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Poly. Module 7 is the final module of the course. In this module, you'll review what you've learned throughout this course. You'll also be introduced to the next steps you should take if you want to achieve the AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty. Section 1 of this module summarizes the topics you've covered in this course. In section 2, you'll learn more about the AWS documentation. You'll also review two common frameworks for applying AWS services. And finally, section 3 describes the steps you should take if you want to continue working towards the AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty. In this section, you'll learn about some of the more common job roles for machine learning professionals. If you're interested in a data scientist role, focus on developing analytical, statistical, and programming skills. As a data scientist, you'll use those skills to collect, analyze, and interpret large data sets. Some universities now offer degrees in data science, but data scientists often have degrees in related fields like statistics, math, computer science, or economics. As a data scientist, you'll need technical competencies in statistics, machine learning, programming languages, and data analytics. If you'd like to have a career as a machine learning engineer, the skills you'll need will be similar to a data scientist skill set. Like data scientists, machine learning engineers also require technical competencies in statistics and machine learning. However, you'll focus more on programming skills and software architecture than analysis and interpretation. As a machine learning engineer, you'll apply those programming and architecture skills to design and develop machine learning systems. Machine learning engineers often have previous experience with software development, and they rely more heavily on programming and software engineering than other machine learning roles. You might also be interested in a career in science where you can apply machine learning technology to your field. Machine learning is having an impact in everything from astronomy to zoology, so there are many different paths open to you. As an applied science researcher, your primary focus will be on the type of science you're working on. You'll need some of the same skills as a data scientist, but you'll also need to know how to apply those skills to your chosen domain. Thus, applied science roles also require technical competencies in statistics and machine learning. Many software developers are now integrating machine learning into their applications. If you're interested in a career as a software developer, you should also include machine learning technology in your studies. As a machine learning developer, your primary focus will be software development skills. But you'll also need some of the same skills as a data scientist, so make sure you take coursework in statistics and applied mathematics. And here's a final note for this module. We recommend reviewing your student guide. In your student guide, you'll find links to documentation and other resources you'll use throughout the course. That's it for this introduction. Thanks for watching. We'll see you in the next video.
